                Back in 2018, I took Andrew Ng's machine learning course.
                I was fascinated by the idea of using a computer to learn and generalize from data.
                This course was what sparked my interest in machine learning and computer science.
                I would build small projects about topics I thought were cool and kept up with the latest developments in the field.

                Currently, I'm studying Computer Science w/ Concentration in ML at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm doing work for Cerebrium AI on the side.
                I also participate in <b><a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/SeaUrc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codeforce</a></b> competitions when I can.
